# TensorQEC

This package utilizes the tensor network to study the properties of *quantum error correction codes* (QEC).The main features include
* Quantum error correction code decoder with tensor network,
* Quantum circuit simulation with tensor network to estimate the threshold of QEC.

Also, we include more general QEC tools, including
* Commonly used QEC code stabilizer generators,
* QEC code distance calculation,
* QEC encoding circuit construction,
* Quantum error correction code stabilizer calculation.
* Quantum error correction code syndrome calculation.
* Quantum error correction code syndrome measurement.
* Quantum error correction code logical operator measurement.
